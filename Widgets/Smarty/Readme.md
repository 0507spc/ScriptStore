# Version:
- 1.1
# Description:
- Enter in your username and password and the script will do the rest. Add in the usage amount if you are on a plan. I am currently on unlimited everything, so not able to see the output for when you are on the limited plans. If someone wants to share the output, I would be happy to alter this.
- You will need the following file to exist in ScriptableApp: ./configs/smarty.json
# Changes:
- No longer maintained as switched contracts.
