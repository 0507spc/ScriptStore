# Description:
- PSA: This is more if I could, rather than if I should. :-)
- This started as a PoC to see what could be achieved with Scriptable. I started to use Shortcuts for the data integration, but, decided to try to do it all in Scriptable. This is that attempt.
- This simply displays text, the widget is not "fancy". 
- Editing of the text and style is achieved via a web view and url schemes. Interestingly, running the "edit" directly in Scriptable does NOT work, but dies from a widget.
- Add a widget, select StickyNote, the widget param is the note name, unique names allows multiple unique widgets.
- Click the text to open the edit note and style. Click save to write this back, thats it.
- Requires a "config" folder in the Scriptable directory. (TODO: add create folder if not exist)
