# ScriptStore

ScriptStore is an attempt to log and showcase some of the widgets on offer. This serves as an initial repository showcasing the various widgets and functions I have found. Feel free to add pull requests for new widgets and features. Ideally, I would like to make this into a site for easy searching, viewing etc. Baby steps at first. Enjoy. If you want your script removing, please do let me know.
